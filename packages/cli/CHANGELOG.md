# @awthaq/cli

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 90feda3: Windows credential backend: `awthaq login` keeps its token as a DPAPI blob (`%APPDATA%\awthaq\credential.dpapi`) protected through PowerShell, with the secret on stdin and never argv. A Windows without PowerShell still falls back to the 0600 file with the warning.
- 3514b28: The OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant (RFC 8628) ships as `@awthaq/device-authorization`, and `awthaq login` uses it (DAG-002, DAG-004, DAG-005; BEH-EA-299 to BEH-EA-307).
  
  - `@awthaq/device-authorization`: `POST /device/code` and `POST /device/token` (the polling states `authorization_pending`, `slow_down`, `access_denied`, `expired_token`, at-most-once redemption), `POST /device/verify` / `approve` / `deny` for the page a signed-in user approves on, public clients from configuration or an operator's `registerClient`, hashed user and device codes, per-address, per-session and per-client rate limits, a `BeforeDeviceApproval` veto, erasure and export contributions, and `purgeExpired`. The minted session is an ordinary bearer session carrying the approving session's `amr`. Tables `device_authorization_grant` and `device_authorization_client` (append-only migrations); Postgres-tested.
  - `@awthaq/cli`: `awthaq login` without a token runs the device flow (a code and URL on stderr, a browser opened unless `--no-browser`, polling with +5 seconds on every `slow_down`); `--client-id` names the client (default `awthaq-cli`, which the plugin registers by default). A server without the plugin exits 9 naming it; a denied or expired request exits 8. `--token` and `AWTHAQ_TOKEN` are unchanged.
  - `@awthaq/core`: two audit events, `auth.deviceAuthorization.approved` and `.denied`.
  - `@awthaq/two-factor`: the session gate no longer diverts an `amr` that already records `mfa` (only this plugin's own completed challenge writes it), so a device approved from a session that proved a second factor is not asked again.
  - `@awthaq/api`: `Api.BackChannel`, an annotation for credential-in-the-request endpoints called by non-browser clients (`apikey.token`, the device `code`/`token` pair): they deliberately carry no `CsrfProtection`, and `awthaq doctor` no longer flags them as unprotected mutating endpoints (`@awthaq/api-key` annotates its token group).
- 4688890: Plugins declare their rate-limit rules and required ports statically, and `awthaq plugin list` prints them (PV-241).
  
  - `@awthaq/core`: `AuthPlugin.Service`'s `rateLimits` (each rule's `group` is confined to the plugin's own contract groups by the compiler; `AuthPlugin.declareRateLimits`, `RateLimits.registerDeclared` and `RateLimits.declarationDrift` keep the declaration and the registry from drifting) and `AuthPlugin.layer`'s `ports` (port classes that join the layer's `RIn`; a required `.../ports/...` service that is not declared fails to type-check). Both reach `Auth.make(...).manifest` as `rateLimits` and `ports`, and as the class statics `Plugin.rateLimits` / `Plugin.ports`.
  - `@awthaq/cli`: `plugin list --rules` prints the declared rules; `plugin list --graph` now prints each plugin's required ports and where its declared taps sit in each hook chain (BEH-EA-202, BEH-EA-111).
  - Every shipped plugin that requires ports now declares them; password, oauth, passkey, api-key, magic-link (and email-otp) and two-factor declare their rate-limit rules. `@awthaq/api-key` also registers its per-client token budget, which was enforced but not listed.
  
  Migration: a plugin that calls `AuthPlugin.layer` and requires an `@awthaq/ports` service (`Mailer`, `RateLimiter`, `PasswordHasher`, ...) must add `ports: [...]` naming it, or it no longer type-checks (the message lists the missing keys). A hand-built `Manifest` value (a test fixture) needs `rateLimits: []` and `ports: []`. BEH-EA-111, BEH-EA-202.
- b8fb23c: Requires `@qadi/core`, `@qadi/http` and `@qadi/react` `^0.8.0` (was `^0.7.0`).
  
  `@qadi/http` 0.8.0 answers the `RequirePermission` refusals with typed bodies instead of empty ones so a generated `HttpApiClient` can decode them: a 403 `AccessDenied` carries qadi's public denial view (`subjectId`, `policyTag`, `reason`; never the evaluation trace), a 403 `UndischargedObligation` its tag, a 502 resolver outage its tag plus at most one identifying attribute (never the cause or the resolver's own message); the wiring-mistake 500 stays empty. BEH-EA-157 / REQ-EA-440 (PV-230).
  
  Migration: bump the three `@qadi/*` dependencies to `^0.8.0` together; a host that asserted an empty 403 or 502 body from `RequirePermission` now sees the typed view.
