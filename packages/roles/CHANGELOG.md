# @awthaq/roles

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 349acb4: awthaq now builds on stable effect 4.1 and takes effect, `@effect/*`, qadi and React from the host application instead of bundling them.
  
  - **effect 4.0.0-rc.116 → 4.1.2, qadi 0.8 → 0.11.** Module paths follow effect's stable layout (`effect/http`, `effect/http-api`, `effect/sql`, `effect/encoding/*`).
  - **Peer dependencies.** Every package except `@awthaq/cli` declares `effect` (and, where used, `@effect/*`, `@qadi/*`, React) as `peerDependencies` with a range (`effect: ^4.1.0`, `@qadi/*: ^0.11.0`), so an application has exactly one copy of each. Install them next to awthaq. `pnpm package:smoke` now fails a package that bundles one of them or publishes an exact or prerelease peer.
  - **Crypto services (breaking).** effect 4.1 removed the `Crypto` service. Layers now require effect's `SecureRandom`, `Digest` and/or `Mac` (`effect/crypto/*`) instead; `NodeCrypto.layer` provides all of them, and `@awthaq/ports`' `WebCrypto.layer` now provides the same three over `globalThis.crypto` (`WebCrypto.Services`). Helpers that took a `Crypto` take the specific service: `Hmac.hmacSha256(mac, ...)`, `SecretHash.digest(hasher, ...)`, `Totp.hotp/totp/verifyTotp(mac, ...)`, `RecoveryCodes.generate(random, ...)`, `UserCode.generate(random)` / `hash(hasher, ...)`, and `VerificationLink.issue`/`EmailChange.request` deps take `random` instead of `crypto`. Random bytes and digests no longer fail, so the `PlatformError` → `StoreUnavailable` paths they fed are gone.
  - **`@awthaq/react`** re-exports qadi 0.11's seeded-decision API (`DecisionOutcome`, `SeededAllow`, `SeededDeny`, `isSeeded`, `outcomeOf`, `permits`, `ClientDecision`, `SeededDecision`); the new gate-registry instrumentation (`makeGateRegistry`, `useGateInstances`) is left to `@qadi/react`.
- Add TOTP two-factor authentication (`@awthaq/two-factor`), passwordless sign-in by a POST-only magic link and a six-digit email code (`@awthaq/magic-link`), and session authentication assurance. Verification can mint numeric values with a per-token attempt budget; sessions record RFC 8176 `amr`, which reaches qadi policies and principal JWTs (`amr`, `auth_time`); `Hooks.BeforeCredentialReset` lets a second factor guard password reset; an opt-in admin layer notifies the owner when impersonation starts.
  
  Migration:
  
  - `RateLimiter.of(...)` implementations must now provide `check` (a read-only peek; `layerPermissive` is a no-op). BEH-EA-266, ADR-EA-020.
  - `VerificationRepository.upsertLive` and the `VerificationToken` model gain `maxAttempts` and `attempts`; run core migration 28. BEH-EA-271.
  - `Sessions.AuthMethod` gains `"sms"`; `UserPrincipal` gains `authenticatedAt`. Exhaustive matches over either must handle the new member. BEH-EA-258.
  - `Password.confirmReset` consults `Hooks.BeforeCredentialReset` and answers `SecondFactorRequired` (401) for a user with a confirmed second factor when `secondFactorCode` is missing; composing `@awthaq/two-factor` requires `TwoFactor.sessionGate` and either `TwoFactor.credentialResetGate` or `TwoFactor.noCredentialReset`. BEH-EA-259, BEH-EA-261.
  - `AdminAccounts.setUserPassword` now consults `Hooks.BeforeCredentialReset` (with no second-factor code) and can fail with `HookAborted` (403); for a user protected by `@awthaq/two-factor` an administrator can no longer silently replace the password. BEH-EA-259.
- f0f2f3e: `@awthaq/roles` owns its events (ADR-EA-049): the two `auth.roles.*` definitions moved from `@awthaq/core` to `RolesEvents`, are declared on the plugin's `events`, and are published with `AuthEvents.emit`. Tags, payloads, actors, personal-data fields and attempt lanes are unchanged.
  
  Migration: `AuthEvents.RolesAssignedEvent` and `AuthEvents.RolesRevokedEvent` → `RolesEvents.<same name>` from `@awthaq/roles`. `AuthEvents.AuthEventTag`/`AuthEvent` no longer include `auth.roles.*`: subscribe with `AuthEvents.on(RolesEvents.RolesAssignedEvent, …)`, narrow the stream with `AuthEvents.is(RolesEvents.RolesAssignedEvent)`, decode an audit row with `AuditLog.payloadAs(RolesEvents.RolesAssignedEvent)`, and replace `AuthEvents.payloadOf(e)` with `Schema.decodeUnknownSync(RolesEvents.RolesAssignedEvent)(e)`. ADR-EA-049, BEH-EA-101.
- 77e05bd: The remaining plugin stores fail with `StoreUnavailable` instead of dying (plan 05, ADR-EA-028).
  
  - `ApiKeyRecords`, `ApiKeyClientRecords`, `DeviceGrantRecords`, `DeviceClientRecords`, `PasskeyCredentials` (`recordUsage` included), `PasskeyUserHandles`, `ChallengeStore`, `Roles` (`assign`, `revoke`, `listRoleNames`, `holders`, `listUnknownAssignments`) and `UserClaims` (`get`, `set`, `merge`, `delete`) answer a database failure with the typed `StoreUnavailable` naming `<Records>.<method>`; the services built on them (`ApiKey`, `DeviceAuthorization`, `Passkey`, `RolesAdmin`) widen their `E` accordingly. All their tables are Global (no tenant column).
  - An API-key service-token resolver and a JWT bearer resolver let an outage through as `StoreUnavailable` (a `503`) instead of answering `401`. `@awthaq/qadi`'s `SubjectResolver.resolve` and its `AuthorizedSubject` middleware may fail with `StoreUnavailable` (a roles lookup that is down is no longer a defect), and `UserClaimsAttributes` / `OrganizationQadi` answer it as their own typed resolve error so the policy engine fails closed.
  
  Migration: handle `StoreUnavailable` on the widened methods; an application that implements `SubjectResolverShape`, `RolesShape`, `ChallengeStoreShape` or one of the records shapes adopts the wider `E`. BEH-EA-325.
- 3d00f58: Every plugin declares its tables' tenancy (plan 05, BEH-EA-005, BEH-EA-328).
  
  - `@awthaq/core`: `AuthPlugin.Service`'s `tables` is a record keyed by table name (each `<id>_...`) whose values are `AuthPlugin.Table.partitioned | keyed | derived | global`. A table with no declaration does not compile. The class keeps `tables` (the names) and gains `tenancy`. `Auth.make` validates the declarations (`Auth/TenancyDeclarationInvalid`) and exposes `auth.tenancy` and `manifest.plugins[].tenancy`; pass `auth.tenancy` to `TenantScope.enableRls({ plugins })`.
  - `@awthaq/cli`: `awthaq plugin list` prints each table with its tenancy.
  - Every first-party plugin declares its tables (see ADR-EA-018 decision 10).
  
  Migration: `tables: ["x_y"]` becomes `tables: { x_y: AuthPlugin.Table.global("why") }`. Pick the kind: `partitioned()` for a table with a nullable `"tenantId"` column stamped from the ambient tenant; `keyed("organizationId")` for a table keyed by an organization id; `derived(parentTable, "joinColumn")` for a child scoped through its parent; `global(reason)` for a deliberately tenant-blind table, with the reason. `tables: []` becomes `tables: {}`. A hand-built `AuthPlugin.Any` may still use `tables: [..]` and omit `tenancy`.
- b8fb23c: Requires `@qadi/core`, `@qadi/http` and `@qadi/react` `^0.8.0` (was `^0.7.0`).
  
  `@qadi/http` 0.8.0 answers the `RequirePermission` refusals with typed bodies instead of empty ones so a generated `HttpApiClient` can decode them: a 403 `AccessDenied` carries qadi's public denial view (`subjectId`, `policyTag`, `reason`; never the evaluation trace), a 403 `UndischargedObligation` its tag, a 502 resolver outage its tag plus at most one identifying attribute (never the cause or the resolver's own message); the wiring-mistake 500 stays empty. BEH-EA-157 / REQ-EA-440 (PV-230).
  
  Migration: bump the three `@qadi/*` dependencies to `^0.8.0` together; a host that asserted an empty 403 or 502 body from `RequirePermission` now sees the typed view.
- c76f03c: `Roles` persists through a record store, `RoleAssignments`, declared as `Roles.records` (a matched `{ memory, sql }` bundle), and `Roles.layerSql` is removed.
  
  - New record store `RoleAssignments` (key `awthaq/roles/records/RoleAssignments`) with `layerMemory` and `layerSql`. `Roles` is now written once over it: catalog validation, `UnknownRole` and the audit events live in one implementation instead of two copies over different storage. `Roles.layer` requires the store.
  
  Migration: `Roles.layer` now requires `RoleAssignments`: provide `Roles.records.memory` (what `Roles.layer` used to carry) beneath it. `Roles.layerSql` is gone: use `Roles.layer` with `Roles.records.sql` (`Roles.layer.pipe(Layer.provide(Roles.records.sql), Layer.provide(Roles.config(catalog)))`). A composition served through `Auth.make` and `TestAuth.layer` needs nothing: the harness selects the bundle.
- d82b7a4: The request context is required, by the type (ADR-EA-047). Every awthaq group declares `Api.RequestContext` as its last (outermost) middleware; `AuthHttp.middlewareFor` (so `AuthHost.layer` and `TestAuth`) derives its implementation, `RequestContext.RequestContextLive`, which reads the `ClientAddress` port, `x-request-id`/`traceparent` and `User-Agent` once per request. The four authentication middlewares `require` the context, so declaring them outside it is a compile error, and credential claims receive it. The global `RequestContext.layer`, its build-time warning and `AuthHost`'s `requestContext` dial are gone. qadi's Path B extractor reads the context when its group declares it and captures the same facts itself otherwise. The OpenAPI document and the derived clients are unchanged.
  
  Migration: delete `RequestContext.layer` from your server layer and `requestContext` from `AuthHost.layer`'s options (the context is derived with the middleware; it needs a `ClientAddress` layer, and `ClientAddress.layerDirect` keeps the socket-peer behaviour); remove any provision of `RequestContext.warnWhenAbsent`. If you build host middleware by hand, provide `RequestContext.RequestContextLive`. On your own `HttpApi` groups that declare `Api.Authentication`, `MachineAuthentication`, `AdminAuthentication` or `OptionalAuthentication`, add `.middleware(Api.RequestContext)` after the last middleware (qadi's `withAuthorizedSubject`/`withOptionalAuthorizedSubject` do it for you). A custom credential resolver may read `Api.AuthRequestContext`; `Credentials.httpScope(request, context)` takes the context. `SubjectExtractorLive` now requires `ClientAddress` and `SecureRandom`.

### Patch Changes

- 1cef4be: `GET /admin/config` under a tenant now shows that tenant's configuration in force, not the build value. Each item carries a `scope` (`tenant` or `deployment`) and `source` may be `"tenant"` (BEH-EA-355, BEH-EA-356). Descriptors now also exist for MagicLink, EmailOtp, Scim, Sso, `AccountsPolicy` and `RateLimitOverrides`.
  
  For plugin authors, each configuration key declares its scope next to its reference: `Tenant.perTenant(Reference, { boot })` or `Tenant.perDeployment(Reference)` (ADR-EA-018 decision 8, revision 1.7). A module reads the key with `Tenant.inForce(declared)`, `config(...)` returns the declaration's `layer`, and a `ConfigDescriptor` is made from the declaration. A per-deployment `config(...)` provides `Tenant.DeploymentConfigApplied`, so a `TenantConfig` lookup that carries one does not type-check. `TwoFactorConfig` and `RolesConfig` are per-deployment too, so a `TenantConfig` lookup carrying either no longer type-checks (Migration: provide them once through `TwoFactor.config(...)` / `Roles.config(...)`); `ConfigDescriptor.make` takes a declaration only, not a bare `Context.Reference`.
  
  Migration: a plugin's `Tenant.configInForce(Ref, built)` (removed) becomes a declaration `const RefScoped = Tenant.perTenant(Ref)` (or `Tenant.perDeployment(Ref)`) and `const now = yield* Tenant.inForce(RefScoped)`; its `config(...)` returns `RefScoped.layer(value)`, and `ConfigDescriptor.make(RefScoped, …)` replaces `ConfigDescriptor.make(Ref, …)`. A `TenantConfig` lookup that merged a per-deployment `config(...)` (magic link, email OTP, api-key, device authorization, SAML, SSO, SCIM, or a host-level key such as `SessionCookie.config`) no longer compiles: that setting was never applied per tenant; move it to the deployment's composition. `GET /admin/config` items carry `scope`, `source` may be `"tenant"`, and under a tenant the items show that tenant's values. `EffectiveConfig.snapshot` takes the build context as its first argument.
- 1cef4be: Each table's migrations moved into its records module and are written once for both dialects. Migration names and order are unchanged; an already-migrated database applies nothing new and `awthaq migration status` reports no drift. Plugin indexes are created `IF NOT EXISTS` (SSMS-006), so an index built `CONCURRENTLY` beforehand no longer fails the deploy.
  
  Migration: none.
- 1cef4be: Built against `@qadi/core`, `@qadi/http` and `@qadi/react` 0.12 (the peer ranges move from `^0.11.0` to `^0.12.0`). `@awthaq/qadi`'s `ObligationHandlers.reauth` is an `ObligationHandler` of 0.12, so it takes the `{ question, decision }` discharge and reads `decision.obligations`; `onObligations: ObligationHandlers.reauth` is unchanged. `@awthaq/react` re-exports the new `useQuestions` hook (the devtools dock feed, `useDevtoolsFeed` and `runtimeLayer`, stays on `@qadi/react`).
  
  Migration: a host with an endpoint that declares neither `RequiredPermission` nor `publicEndpoint` (or that `RequirePermission` does not cover) now fails at startup, when `guardApi` is built, with `AccessNotDeclared` or `RequirePermissionNotAttached`, instead of serving a 500 per request: annotate the endpoint. A direct call `ObligationHandlers.reauth([...obligations])` becomes `ObligationHandlers.reauth({ question, decision })`; guard a Path B `HttpApi` with `guardApi(Api)` (replaces `RequirePermissionLive` and `registerApi`, provide `PermissionRegistryLive` once where the stack is composed) and see the `@qadi/http` 0.12 changelog for the rest.
- 80c465c: `RoleAssignments` has its first store-level suite, a RecordsContract suite (plan 25 ticket 24, ADR-EA-041 decision 9, F11): every operation carries a verdict, and `add`/`remove` are proven atomic and idempotent by 8-way race cases on memory and SQL, Postgres included under `pnpm test:pg`. No behaviour changes.
