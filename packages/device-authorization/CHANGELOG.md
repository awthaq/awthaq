# @awthaq/device-authorization

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fe9dc94: Sign-in completion is one core module, `SignIn` (BEH-EA-322, ADR-EA-038). Every first factor (password, passkey, OAuth, SAML, device authorization, magic link, email OTP) and the second factor now finish through it: `clear` returns a branded `Clearance` (user lookup, suspension gate, `BeforeSignIn`, `BeforeSessionIssue`), `issue` is the only way to mint a session from it, `complete` is both, and `resume` is the divert owner's entry.
  
  - A suspended account's refusal publishes `auth.user.signInFailed { reason: "suspended" }` for every strategy, not only password.
  - A SAML sign-in completed by a second factor now keeps `fed` in its `amr`, is recorded for Single Logout, is role-mapped, and keeps its connection's tenant: the SAML Single Logout record and role mapping are a sign-in continuation (`SignIn.continuation`) that crosses the divert.
  - A user erased between credential proof and session issue is refused with the flow's own uniform error (OAuth: `OAuthCallbackFailed`; SAML: `SamlAssertionRejected`; password and passkey: `InvalidCredentials`) instead of a 500.
  - `Hooks.BeforeSessionIssue`'s input now always carries `amr` (required) and may carry a `handoff` (`{ tenantId?, continuation? }`); the second-factor challenge stores it.
  - `@awthaq/test` gains `SignInProbe`, recording taps for the sign-in and sign-up hook points.
  
  Migration: a custom `BeforeSessionIssue.run` caller must pass `amr`. A custom divert tap that later completes the sign-in itself must return the `handoff` it received to `SignIn.resume`. A detector counting `signInFailed` gains suspended refusals from every strategy. Plugin authors: finish a sign-in with `SignIn.make` (`complete`, or `clear`/`issue`), never `Sessions.issue`.
- 2c3c400: `CurrentUser.current` is the one read of a user-tier caller; `Sessions.IssuedSession`/`Sessions.VerifiedSession` name what `issue`/`verify` return; `ClientAddress.facts`/`address` build a Shape's explicit `ip`/`userAgent` from a request.
  
  Migration: `Password.IssuedSession`, `Passkey.IssuedSession`, `TwoFactor.IssuedSession`, `MagicLink.IssuedSession`, `EmailOtp.IssuedSession` and `Admin.IssuedSession` -> `Sessions.IssuedSession`. A non-`User` principal on a user-tier group now dies with `Defects/InvariantViolation` (`invariant: "NonUserPrincipal"`), never `HandlerInvariantViolation`.
- 3514b28: The OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant (RFC 8628) ships as `@awthaq/device-authorization`, and `awthaq login` uses it (DAG-002, DAG-004, DAG-005; BEH-EA-299 to BEH-EA-307).
  
  - `@awthaq/device-authorization`: `POST /device/code` and `POST /device/token` (the polling states `authorization_pending`, `slow_down`, `access_denied`, `expired_token`, at-most-once redemption), `POST /device/verify` / `approve` / `deny` for the page a signed-in user approves on, public clients from configuration or an operator's `registerClient`, hashed user and device codes, per-address, per-session and per-client rate limits, a `BeforeDeviceApproval` veto, erasure and export contributions, and `purgeExpired`. The minted session is an ordinary bearer session carrying the approving session's `amr`. Tables `device_authorization_grant` and `device_authorization_client` (append-only migrations); Postgres-tested.
  - `@awthaq/cli`: `awthaq login` without a token runs the device flow (a code and URL on stderr, a browser opened unless `--no-browser`, polling with +5 seconds on every `slow_down`); `--client-id` names the client (default `awthaq-cli`, which the plugin registers by default). A server without the plugin exits 9 naming it; a denied or expired request exits 8. `--token` and `AWTHAQ_TOKEN` are unchanged.
  - `@awthaq/core`: two audit events, `auth.deviceAuthorization.approved` and `.denied`.
  - `@awthaq/two-factor`: the session gate no longer diverts an `amr` that already records `mfa` (only this plugin's own completed challenge writes it), so a device approved from a session that proved a second factor is not asked again.
  - `@awthaq/api`: `Api.BackChannel`, an annotation for credential-in-the-request endpoints called by non-browser clients (`apikey.token`, the device `code`/`token` pair): they deliberately carry no `CsrfProtection`, and `awthaq doctor` no longer flags them as unprotected mutating endpoints (`@awthaq/api-key` annotates its token group).
- 349acb4: awthaq now builds on stable effect 4.1 and takes effect, `@effect/*`, qadi and React from the host application instead of bundling them.
  
  - **effect 4.0.0-rc.116 → 4.1.2, qadi 0.8 → 0.11.** Module paths follow effect's stable layout (`effect/http`, `effect/http-api`, `effect/sql`, `effect/encoding/*`).
  - **Peer dependencies.** Every package except `@awthaq/cli` declares `effect` (and, where used, `@effect/*`, `@qadi/*`, React) as `peerDependencies` with a range (`effect: ^4.1.0`, `@qadi/*: ^0.11.0`), so an application has exactly one copy of each. Install them next to awthaq. `pnpm package:smoke` now fails a package that bundles one of them or publishes an exact or prerelease peer.
  - **Crypto services (breaking).** effect 4.1 removed the `Crypto` service. Layers now require effect's `SecureRandom`, `Digest` and/or `Mac` (`effect/crypto/*`) instead; `NodeCrypto.layer` provides all of them, and `@awthaq/ports`' `WebCrypto.layer` now provides the same three over `globalThis.crypto` (`WebCrypto.Services`). Helpers that took a `Crypto` take the specific service: `Hmac.hmacSha256(mac, ...)`, `SecretHash.digest(hasher, ...)`, `Totp.hotp/totp/verifyTotp(mac, ...)`, `RecoveryCodes.generate(random, ...)`, `UserCode.generate(random)` / `hash(hasher, ...)`, and `VerificationLink.issue`/`EmailChange.request` deps take `random` instead of `crypto`. Random bytes and digests no longer fail, so the `PlatformError` → `StoreUnavailable` paths they fed are gone.
  - **`@awthaq/react`** re-exports qadi 0.11's seeded-decision API (`DecisionOutcome`, `SeededAllow`, `SeededDeny`, `isSeeded`, `outcomeOf`, `permits`, `ClientDecision`, `SeededDecision`); the new gate-registry instrumentation (`makeGateRegistry`, `useGateInstances`) is left to `@qadi/react`.
- fcdb168: `@awthaq/device-authorization` owns its events (ADR-EA-049): the two `auth.deviceAuthorization.*` definitions moved from `@awthaq/core` to `DeviceAuthorizationEvents`, are declared on the plugin's `events`, and are published with `AuthEvents.emit`. Tags, payloads, actors, personal-data fields and attempt lanes are unchanged.
  
  Migration: `AuthEvents.DeviceAuthorizationApprovedEvent` and `AuthEvents.DeviceAuthorizationDeniedEvent` → `DeviceAuthorizationEvents.<same name>` from `@awthaq/device-authorization`. `AuthEvents.AuthEventTag`/`AuthEvent` no longer include `auth.deviceAuthorization.*`: subscribe with `AuthEvents.on(DeviceAuthorizationEvents.DeviceAuthorizationApprovedEvent, …)`, narrow the stream with `AuthEvents.is(DeviceAuthorizationEvents.DeviceAuthorizationApprovedEvent)`, decode an audit row with `AuditLog.payloadAs(DeviceAuthorizationEvents.DeviceAuthorizationApprovedEvent)`, and replace `AuthEvents.payloadOf(e)` with `Schema.decodeUnknownSync(DeviceAuthorizationEvents.DeviceAuthorizationApprovedEvent)(e)`. ADR-EA-049, BEH-EA-101.
- 77e05bd: The remaining plugin stores fail with `StoreUnavailable` instead of dying (plan 05, ADR-EA-028).
  
  - `ApiKeyRecords`, `ApiKeyClientRecords`, `DeviceGrantRecords`, `DeviceClientRecords`, `PasskeyCredentials` (`recordUsage` included), `PasskeyUserHandles`, `ChallengeStore`, `Roles` (`assign`, `revoke`, `listRoleNames`, `holders`, `listUnknownAssignments`) and `UserClaims` (`get`, `set`, `merge`, `delete`) answer a database failure with the typed `StoreUnavailable` naming `<Records>.<method>`; the services built on them (`ApiKey`, `DeviceAuthorization`, `Passkey`, `RolesAdmin`) widen their `E` accordingly. All their tables are Global (no tenant column).
  - An API-key service-token resolver and a JWT bearer resolver let an outage through as `StoreUnavailable` (a `503`) instead of answering `401`. `@awthaq/qadi`'s `SubjectResolver.resolve` and its `AuthorizedSubject` middleware may fail with `StoreUnavailable` (a roles lookup that is down is no longer a defect), and `UserClaimsAttributes` / `OrganizationQadi` answer it as their own typed resolve error so the policy engine fails closed.
  
  Migration: handle `StoreUnavailable` on the widened methods; an application that implements `SubjectResolverShape`, `RolesShape`, `ChallengeStoreShape` or one of the records shapes adopts the wider `E`. BEH-EA-325.
- 3d00f58: Every plugin declares its tables' tenancy (plan 05, BEH-EA-005, BEH-EA-328).
  
  - `@awthaq/core`: `AuthPlugin.Service`'s `tables` is a record keyed by table name (each `<id>_...`) whose values are `AuthPlugin.Table.partitioned | keyed | derived | global`. A table with no declaration does not compile. The class keeps `tables` (the names) and gains `tenancy`. `Auth.make` validates the declarations (`Auth/TenancyDeclarationInvalid`) and exposes `auth.tenancy` and `manifest.plugins[].tenancy`; pass `auth.tenancy` to `TenantScope.enableRls({ plugins })`.
  - `@awthaq/cli`: `awthaq plugin list` prints each table with its tenancy.
  - Every first-party plugin declares its tables (see ADR-EA-018 decision 10).
  
  Migration: `tables: ["x_y"]` becomes `tables: { x_y: AuthPlugin.Table.global("why") }`. Pick the kind: `partitioned()` for a table with a nullable `"tenantId"` column stamped from the ambient tenant; `keyed("organizationId")` for a table keyed by an organization id; `derived(parentTable, "joinColumn")` for a child scoped through its parent; `global(reason)` for a deliberately tenant-blind table, with the reason. `tables: []` becomes `tables: {}`. A hand-built `AuthPlugin.Any` may still use `tables: [..]` and omit `tenancy`.
- e012560: Device authorization declares its nine rate-limit rules as a `rateLimitRules` table and spends them through `RateLimits.budget` (plan 06). `DeviceAuthorizationConfig.codeRateLimit`, `userCodeRateLimit` and `invalidGrantRateLimit` keep working: they tune the declared defaults.
  
  - A refused failure-budget lookup (`guard`) is now also logged and counted in `awthaq.ratelimit.exceeded`, like every other breach (it used to publish the event only).
  - `code-client` breaches report `dimension: "identity"` (was `"custom"`).
  
  Migration: rule labels are renamed (they appear in `auth.rateLimit.exceeded.rule`, in the `awthaq.ratelimit.exceeded` metric and in `plugin list --rules`): `code-ip` is `codeByIp`, `code-client` is `codeByClient`, `token-invalid-ip` is `invalidGrantByIp`, `verify-ip`/`approve-ip`/`deny-ip` are `verifyByIp`/`approveByIp`/`denyByIp` and `verify-session`/`approve-session`/`deny-session` are `verifyBySession`/`approveBySession`/`denyBySession`. Rate-limit buckets are renamed too (`device:code:ip:<ip>` becomes `ratelimit:device_authorization.codeByIp:ip:<ip>`, and the shared user-code lookups use `ratelimit:device_authorization.userCode:ip:<ip>` / `:session:<id>`), so a deploy resets the live counters once; entries in a shared store expire within 15 minutes.
- 058aafe: `DeviceAuthorization.records` is the plugin's grant and client stores as one matched `{ memory, sql }` bundle, and the stores' service keys gain the `/records/` segment.
  
  - `DeviceGrantRecords` and `DeviceClientRecords` are keyed `awthaq/device-authorization/records/<Name>`; the bundle provides both over memory and over SQL, and `AuthPlugin.layer` refuses a layer that requires a store the bundle does not provide.
  
  Migration: code that built a `Context` by the old key string must use the class. A host replaces the pair of `layerMemory` / `layerSql` layers with `DeviceAuthorization.records.memory` / `DeviceAuthorization.records.sql`.
- 6f54095: `DeviceAuthorization` reads no request facts (ADR-EA-047). `requestCode`, `poll`, `verify`, `approve` and `deny` take no `ip` (and `poll` no `{ userAgent }` argument) and require `Api.AuthRequestContext`: the per-source rules key on the request's address and the redeemed session records the device's address and user agent. The plugin layer no longer requires `ClientAddress`.
  
  Migration: drop `ip` from calls to `requestCode`, `poll`, `verify`, `approve` and `deny`, and the second argument of `poll`; provide `Api.AuthRequestContext` to an in-process call (`Api.AuthRequestContext.noRequest`, `RequestContext.capture(request)`, or `TestAuth.withRequest`).
- d82b7a4: The request context is required, by the type (ADR-EA-047). Every awthaq group declares `Api.RequestContext` as its last (outermost) middleware; `AuthHttp.middlewareFor` (so `AuthHost.layer` and `TestAuth`) derives its implementation, `RequestContext.RequestContextLive`, which reads the `ClientAddress` port, `x-request-id`/`traceparent` and `User-Agent` once per request. The four authentication middlewares `require` the context, so declaring them outside it is a compile error, and credential claims receive it. The global `RequestContext.layer`, its build-time warning and `AuthHost`'s `requestContext` dial are gone. qadi's Path B extractor reads the context when its group declares it and captures the same facts itself otherwise. The OpenAPI document and the derived clients are unchanged.
  
  Migration: delete `RequestContext.layer` from your server layer and `requestContext` from `AuthHost.layer`'s options (the context is derived with the middleware; it needs a `ClientAddress` layer, and `ClientAddress.layerDirect` keeps the socket-peer behaviour); remove any provision of `RequestContext.warnWhenAbsent`. If you build host middleware by hand, provide `RequestContext.RequestContextLive`. On your own `HttpApi` groups that declare `Api.Authentication`, `MachineAuthentication`, `AdminAuthentication` or `OptionalAuthentication`, add `.middleware(Api.RequestContext)` after the last middleware (qadi's `withAuthorizedSubject`/`withOptionalAuthorizedSubject` do it for you). A custom credential resolver may read `Api.AuthRequestContext`; `Credentials.httpScope(request, context)` takes the context. `SubjectExtractorLive` now requires `ClientAddress` and `SecureRandom`.
- 7e9834e: Plugins contribute their own retention rules to `Retention.sweep`.
  
  - `@awthaq/core`: new `Retention.contribute({ id, order?, make })` and `Retention.RetentionRegistry` (provided by `Hooks.HooksLive`, like the erasure registry). `Retention.sweep` runs every contribution after the core purges, isolates a failing one, and reports `SweepReport.plugins: ReadonlyArray<{ id, deleted, failed }>`; its requirements gain `RetentionRegistry`. ADR-EA-031 Decision 6 amended (revision 1.4); BEH-EA-337.
  - `@awthaq/saml`: contributes `saml.sessions` and no longer prunes session records inside every sign-in.
  - `@awthaq/device-authorization`: contributes `device_authorization.grants`. `@awthaq/jwt`: contributes `jwt.revocations` (`RevocationStore` gains `purgeExpired`). `@awthaq/organization`: contributes `organization.invitations` (new `invitationRetention`, default 30 days; `InvitationRecords` gains `purgeExpired`). `@awthaq/passkey`: contributes `passkey.challenges`. `@awthaq/webhooks`: contributes `webhooks.deliveries` (the worker keeps its hourly prune).
  
  Migration: a composition that installs one of these plugins must provide `Retention.RetentionRegistry`; every `Auth.make` composition and `Hooks.HooksLive` already do. A host with its own `RevocationStore` or `InvitationRecords` implements `purgeExpired`. SAML session records now age out only when the host runs `Retention.sweep` or `Retention.layerScheduled`; a host that relied on the inline prune must schedule the sweep.
- 401a719: Every endpoint that changes the caller's session declares it on the contract, and every credential change goes through `SessionDelivery` (ADR-EA-045, BEH-EA-343).
  
  - `@awthaq/server` implements the server half of the `SessionLifecycle` markers (`SessionLifecycle.layer`, re-exported as `AuthHttp.sessionLifecycle`; derived by `AuthHttp.middlewareFor`). A declared endpoint resolves `X-Awthaq-Token-Delivery` before its handler runs, answers `Cache-Control: no-store`, and dies `SessionLifecycleUnsettled` when a successful response neither delivered nor declined. `SessionDelivery.respond(mint)` takes no request; `mode` and `deliver` are gone; `redirect`, `deliverBearer`, `deliverExchanged`, `end`, `swapIn`, `swapOut` and `decline` cover the rest, each requiring the grant its marker provides. A bearer delivery names the token in `set-auth-token` too (a bearer `changePassword` no longer logs the client out everywhere); an ended session answers `x-awthaq-session-ended` and drops a rotation's `set-auth-token` (both exposed by `AuthHttp.cors`).
  - `@awthaq/api`: core's `session.signOut`/`revoke`/`revokeAll` and `account.deleteUser` declare `SessionLifecycle.Ends`.
  - `@awthaq/core`: `SessionCookie.set`/`expire`/`expireImpersonation` moved into `@awthaq/server` (behind `SessionDelivery`); `SessionCookie.baseOptions` is exported.
  - Plugins: `password` (`signUp`/`signIn` `Mints`, `changePassword` `Rotates`, `reauthenticate` `Refreshes`), `passkey` (`authenticateVerify` `Mints`, `reauthenticateVerify` `Refreshes`), `magic-link` (`magicLink.verify`, `emailOtp.verify`), `two-factor` (`verify`, `verifyRecovery`), `device-authorization` (`token`), `oauth` (`callback`, `exchange.token`), `saml` (`acs` `Mints`, `logout` `Ends`), `admin` (`impersonate`/`stopImpersonating`/`forceStop` `Swaps`: a bearer request answers `400` before anything is minted), `organization` (`setActive`, `setActiveTeam`, `leave`, `acceptInvitation` `Refreshes`). Their hand-written `InvalidTokenDelivery` error entries are gone (the marker declares it).
  
  Migration: add `.middleware(SessionLifecycle.<Kind>)` to your endpoint and drop `Api.InvalidTokenDelivery` from its errors; replace `SessionDelivery.respond(request, mint)` with `SessionDelivery.respond(mint)` and `SessionDelivery.mode(request)` (mint nothing) with `SessionDelivery.decline(SessionLifecycle.MintGrant)`; replace `SessionCookie.set`/`expire`/`expireImpersonation` with the `SessionDelivery` function for your declared kind. A composition that wires host middleware by hand provides `AuthHttp.sessionLifecycle`. Never write the session cookie yourself. ADR-EA-045, BEH-EA-343, BEH-EA-066.

### Patch Changes

- 1cef4be: `GET /admin/config` under a tenant now shows that tenant's configuration in force, not the build value. Each item carries a `scope` (`tenant` or `deployment`) and `source` may be `"tenant"` (BEH-EA-355, BEH-EA-356). Descriptors now also exist for MagicLink, EmailOtp, Scim, Sso, `AccountsPolicy` and `RateLimitOverrides`.
  
  For plugin authors, each configuration key declares its scope next to its reference: `Tenant.perTenant(Reference, { boot })` or `Tenant.perDeployment(Reference)` (ADR-EA-018 decision 8, revision 1.7). A module reads the key with `Tenant.inForce(declared)`, `config(...)` returns the declaration's `layer`, and a `ConfigDescriptor` is made from the declaration. A per-deployment `config(...)` provides `Tenant.DeploymentConfigApplied`, so a `TenantConfig` lookup that carries one does not type-check. `TwoFactorConfig` and `RolesConfig` are per-deployment too, so a `TenantConfig` lookup carrying either no longer type-checks (Migration: provide them once through `TwoFactor.config(...)` / `Roles.config(...)`); `ConfigDescriptor.make` takes a declaration only, not a bare `Context.Reference`.
  
  Migration: a plugin's `Tenant.configInForce(Ref, built)` (removed) becomes a declaration `const RefScoped = Tenant.perTenant(Ref)` (or `Tenant.perDeployment(Ref)`) and `const now = yield* Tenant.inForce(RefScoped)`; its `config(...)` returns `RefScoped.layer(value)`, and `ConfigDescriptor.make(RefScoped, …)` replaces `ConfigDescriptor.make(Ref, …)`. A `TenantConfig` lookup that merged a per-deployment `config(...)` (magic link, email OTP, api-key, device authorization, SAML, SSO, SCIM, or a host-level key such as `SessionCookie.config`) no longer compiles: that setting was never applied per tenant; move it to the deployment's composition. `GET /admin/config` items carry `scope`, `source` may be `"tenant"`, and under a tenant the items show that tenant's values. `EffectiveConfig.snapshot` takes the build context as its first argument.
- 9950d93: The device-authorization record stores have RecordsContract suites (plan 25 ticket 19, ADR-EA-041 decision 9):
  
  - `DeviceGrantRecords`' compare-and-swap primitives (`claim`, `decide`, `raiseInterval`, `consume`) and `insert` are proven atomic by 8-way race cases on memory and SQL, Postgres included under `pnpm test:pg`. Before, they ran on memory only. `DeviceClientRecords` has its first adapter-level suite.
  - The in-memory `DeviceGrantRecords.insert` refuses a taken grant id (`false`), as the SQL adapter already did. Before, it overwrote the row.
  - A `DeviceGrantRecords.insert` outage is a `StoreUnavailable` with the operation `DeviceGrantRecords.insert`. Before, it was labelled `DeviceGrantRecords.amr`.
  
  Migration: a custom adapter through `@awthaq/device-authorization`'s `DeviceGrantRecords` must answer `false` from `insert` when the grant id is taken, as well as when either code hash is, in one conditional write (memory: one `Ref.modify`; SQL: `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING id`).
- 40a32a1: `Organization` and `DeviceAuthorization` declare the hook points they own (`hookPoints`), so a composition harness can provide them once. No behaviour change.
