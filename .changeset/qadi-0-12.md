Built against `@qadi/core`, `@qadi/http` and `@qadi/react` 0.12 (the peer ranges move from `^0.11.0` to `^0.12.0`). `@awthaq/qadi`'s `ObligationHandlers.reauth` is an `ObligationHandler` of 0.12, so it takes the `{ question, decision }` discharge and reads `decision.obligations`; `onObligations: ObligationHandlers.reauth` is unchanged. `@awthaq/react` re-exports the new `useQuestions` hook (the devtools dock feed, `useDevtoolsFeed` and `runtimeLayer`, stays on `@qadi/react`).

Migration: a host with an endpoint that declares neither `RequiredPermission` nor `publicEndpoint` (or that `RequirePermission` does not cover) now fails at startup, when `guardApi` is built, with `AccessNotDeclared` or `RequirePermissionNotAttached`, instead of serving a 500 per request: annotate the endpoint. A direct call `ObligationHandlers.reauth([...obligations])` becomes `ObligationHandlers.reauth({ question, decision })`; guard a Path B `HttpApi` with `guardApi(Api)` (replaces `RequirePermissionLive` and `registerApi`, provide `PermissionRegistryLive` once where the stack is composed) and see the `@qadi/http` 0.12 changelog for the rest.
